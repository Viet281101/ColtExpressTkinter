# Colt Express with Tkinter Python


### Project theme:
This project invites you to build an electronic and somewhat simplified version of the Colt Express game. 

#### Overview of game rules:
The game takes place on board a train, consisting of a locomotive and a number of equal carriages
to the number of players. Players embody bandits who have jumped on board to rob the
passengers. Objective: collect as much loot as possible, each for himself. This is a game of
programming, in which one alternates between two phases:
● Planning: each player secretly decides on a certain number of actions, which his
character will perform in order.
● Action: perform all the actions number 1, then all the number 2, and this until the
end.
The bandits can be in the wagons or the locomotive, and for each of these elements
either indoors or on the roof. In this statement, by abuse of language, we will designate by car a
any element of the train, which may be the locomotive. The possible actions for bandits are:
● Move one car forwards or backwards, staying on the same floor.
● Go inside or climb onto the roof of their current wagon.
● Rob a traveler to collect loot (or simply loot loot that has been
left there).
● Shoot another nearby bandit to make him drop his loot.
The loot recoverable on board the train are:
● Purses worth €100 or €200, from passengers, inside the wagons.
● Jewelry worth €500, from passengers, inside the wagons.
● A hoard worth €1000, inside the locomotive, in the custody of the Marshall.
A Marshall is present on board the train and can move between the locomotive and the wagons,
always staying inside. He shoots at all the bandits who are in the same position as him and
forced to take refuge on the roof.
